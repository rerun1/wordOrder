#### Word Order and Repetition Using Form
#### _**by Suzi Rubino â€” August 13th, 2019**_
<br>

## Description
Website has form for users to input a block of text and returns a list of all the unique words and how many times they appeared.

For example, if the user inputs "hello world world", the page should show:

hello 1
world 2


Also try ordering the list by the number of appearances - greatest to least. For words that appear the same amount of times, order by which word appeared first.

## Objectives
- [] JavaScript business logic and user interface logic are separate.
- [] Variable names are descriptive and use lower camel case (e.g. myVariableExample).
- [] Code is clean, well-refactored, and easy-to-read. This includes correct indendation, spacing, and including only necessary comments and debugging tools.
- [] Application implements a for loop and works as expected.
All previous objectives have been met.
- [] Project is broken down into "plain English" specs, listed in README.
- [] Project is in a presentable, portfolio-quality state.
- [] Practice styling with imagery and fonts
